# Contributing

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Eik ðŸ§¡

You can find [the general contribution docs here](https://github.com/eik-lib/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This module is a [shared config for prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html#sharing-configurations). We accept changes that should apply to all repositories in the [eik-lib origanisation](https://github.com/eik-lib).

A change in configuration is considered a `patch` in [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A new export would be a `minor`. Depending on a newer version of Prettier would be a `major`.
